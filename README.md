## Description:
The Password Generator is a static html page that allows a user to define input options that sets the criteria to generate a random password string. The input values have validations that alert a user if a selected option falls outside of the accepted criteria. A generated password can contain between 8 and 24 characters and must be made up of at least all lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, or a combination of any of these four inputs.

## Installation:
No installation required. To access the Password Generato make sure you are connected to a WiFi network, or are on a data plan for mobile, and follow the GitHub Pages Link [here:](https://snovelli1021.github.io/PasswordGenerator/)
